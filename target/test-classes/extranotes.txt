	Google stopped supporting "Less Secure Apps" as of May 30th, 2022.
	One of the alternatives to solve this problem is to use 2-Step Verification

	Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification -> Input password as asked -> 
	Turn ON (you could use SMS to get Gmail code to activate 2-Step Verification)
	Google Account -> Security -> App password -> Input password as asked -> 
	Select the app and device... -> e.g. Other(Custom name) -> Input app name 
	e.g. MyApp -> Generate -> Copy a 16-character password -> Use a 16-character 
	password with Gmail username in our automation code.
